        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m an aspiring web developer, loving every single moment of my journey towards becoming a front-end developer.
          Before this desire to learn coding &amp; programming, I had always dreamed of getting into this field, but I never chased that dream.
          They say that no one can change you, only you can change yourself. I stand by this statement, near &amp; dear to my heart it stays.
          I've worked quite a few different jobs, ranging from my first job with Chipotle at the young age of 17, being a pool service
          technician in beautiful central Florida, throw some landscaping into the mixture, &amp; I was even a Park-Ranger for the County I live in.
          My whole life has shaped me into the person that I am today. I've had great parents, an amazing &amp; supportive girlfriend,
          as well as awesome family &amp; friends. There is always at least one key person in all of our lives.
          No one could compare to my <b>best friend</b>, <b>my mother</b>, Cynthia Garner. I wouldn't be the man I am today without her. She passed away
          January 27th, 2018 due to brain cancer. The impact she had on my life simply can not be put into words.
          My dreams won't come looking for me, I must go &amp;
          find them. Which leads me to where I am now, the journey to becoming a life-long programmer, &amp; one day teacher.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>React</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm determined to get as much out of this life as possible. You only live once, so cliche but so true.
          My goals range from short-term, long-term, small, huge, &amp; everything in between. Don't worry, I will list only those relevant to the situation.
          To begin with, one of the <b>many</b> goals I have is to develop my skills enough to become a full-time front-end developer. Whether it be for
          a large company or a start-up, I am very eager &amp; excited to be employed doing something I absolutely love. The journey doesn't stop there, I am
          committed to a lifetime of learning. Once employed, I will be learning and applying everything I possibly can. One thing that is so
          great about programming, you are only limited by yourself.
          Another goal of mine is to develop my skill set to the best of my abilities, to one day be able to teach other up &amp; coming programmers.
          Being a self-taught developer is a very long journey, to be able to teach &amp; support others going through the difficult challenges
          they will face, is another dream of mine. Wink wink treehouse team.

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>Before I started this journey, I had never even written a line of code. The experience you see below is not
          necessarily relavent, but it's where some of the roots of my life have grown from.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>In today's day &amp; age, where it seems everything just goes so fast, it can be difficult
           to find the time for hobbies. However, we always find time to do what we love.
           Spending time with my girlfriend &amp; Nova (our Siberian Husky) is so important to me, I value
           every moment we spend together. I'm truly grateful to have them in my life.
           When I'm not spending time with those two, I'm on my computer learning code &amp; programming. I truly want to
           become a developer. My plan is front-end first, then transition into full-stack, &amp; then go wherever my heart
           desires. I'm excited, eager, but patient. The journey is long, who knows where I will go, what I will
           fall in love with. We must love what we do. My time will come, I will have my chance, putting in the
           hard work now will pay off later.
           Another one of my favorite things to do is anything 'active'.
           Well, anything is a very broad word. I'll narrow it down. I love to play sports. Soccer <i>'football'</i>
           (depending on where you're from) is my absolute favorite sport to play. Whether it be in the backyard
           with my Siberian Husky, or at the park with my girlfriend &amp; Nova, I really can't get enough of it. Working
           out &amp; lifting weights are at the top of the list as well. When all of this is said &amp; done, the day is
           over, it's time to rest, recover, &amp; get back at it again tomorrow.
